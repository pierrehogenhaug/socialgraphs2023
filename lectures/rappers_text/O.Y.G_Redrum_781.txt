== History ==
Carter was born in Bronx, New York. He resided with his mother and young brother there until the age of 5, when he relocated to Inglewood, California with his family. Unfamiliar with their new surroundings and because of the infestation of drug dealers and addicts, pimps and prostitutes, hustlers, and gang-bangers, his mother feared when he and his young sibling would try to venture outside. Eventually his younger brother was initiated into the Avenue Piru Blood Gang (APG's, in Inglewood, CA); being fearful for his little brother's safety RedRum soon found himself being initiated into the same gang to protect his younger brother. He began to write and rhyme, to express his life experiences through his music. He actively started rapping when he attended Morningside High School, winning several talent shows and contests.

Actual gang members from both sides auditioned on a tryout and the best ones were chosen for the project. The album was released in 1993 on Warlock Records and was a success selling over at many copies. There is also another album from the Bloods and the Crips on the Bangin' project titled "Bangin' on Wax 2... The Saga Continues", which was released in 1994.
