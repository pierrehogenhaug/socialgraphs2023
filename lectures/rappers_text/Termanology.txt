== Life and career ==
In collaboration with the New Hampshire producer DC the MIDI Alien, Carrillo independently released the album Out the Gate in 2005. The single "This Is Hip Hop" attracted the attention of The Source, which featured the rapper in its much-coveted "Unsigned Hype" column.
A friendship with the Gang Starr Foundation member Krumbsnatcha led to a meeting with DJ Premier, who was a fan of "This Is Hip Hop". Termanology's DJ Premier-produced 2006 single "Watch How It Go Down" generated considerable national and international  interest, including an appearance in XXL's "Show & Prove" column.A remix of Christina Aguilera's song "Back in the Day", featuring Termanology, was released in 2006.The debut solo album release Politics as Usual on Nature Sounds in 2008 gathered together many of hip hop's most revered producers as DJ Premier was joined by names like Pete Rock, Large Professor, Easy Mo Bee, and Buckwild. It was well received by critics, though many reviewers noted it lacked the focused aggression throughout that "Watch How It Go Down" had promised.The rapper's mixtapes have also attracted critical attention. These include Hood Politics Vols. Iâ€“7 his project over J Dilla beats, If Heaven Was A Mile Away; a collection of fifty of his verses, 50 Bodies; and the compilation of his mixtape cuts, Jackin' for Beats.ST.

In 2009, he wrote and recorded an original song, titled "Here in Liberty City", for the soundtrack to the video game Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned. The mixtape Time Machine, released in late 2009, was described by the artist as "somewhere between a mixtape and an album".1982 was released in October 2010, and is a joint release with producer Statik Selektah. On June 7, 2011, Termanology dropped the mixtape Cameo King II, which is a sequel to Da Cameo King. Later that year he and Ea$y Money made another collaborative project, entitled S.T.R.E.E.T. (Speakin' Thru Real Experience Every Time). In early 2012, Termanology released 50 Bodies Pt. 4 which was hosted by Statik Selektah, D-Stroy, and DJ Deadeye.

In November 2012, Termanology & Lil Fame of the legendary rap group M.O.P., made a collaborative album called Fizzyology, a play on both of their stage names combined.
Hood Politics 7 was released in April 2013 which was promoted on MTV News "Mixtape Mondays". He performed his verse from "Up Every Night (Remix)", which features Kid Ink and Cory Gunz.
