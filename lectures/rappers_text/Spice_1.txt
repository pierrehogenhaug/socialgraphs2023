== Personal life ==
Greene attended Mt. Eden High School in Hayward. In an interview with DJ Vlad, Greene stated he once stole a car that resembled one owned by Too Short and used it to make "doughnuts" (doughnut shaped tire burns) on the street outside of Too Short's mother's house, in an attempt to impress the older rapper.
When Greene received his first large check for his music, he stopped selling drugs and focused on making music instead.In a recording session on September 7, 1996, Greene, Tupac Shakur, and Kokane recorded the song "Fame" together, which is believed to be the last song that Shakur ever recorded before he was shot in Las Vegas later that same night. Greene, being a close personal friend of the late rapper, was on his way to meet up with him in Las Vegas for an after party when he received news about Shakur's shooting.On December 3, 2007, Greene was shot while sitting in his car outside his parents' home in Hayward, California. He survived the shooting and later recovered at a hospital.
