== History ==


=== Self-Titled album (2008) ===
After recording several tracks with Cisco Adler, the duo was signed to Geffen and a self-titled album was produced. Adler helped with songwriting, production, and backup vocals. "Buzzin'" was released on August 19, 2008, as the first single off the album, which was entitled Shwayze. The single "Corona and Lime" soon followed. "Buzzin'" shot up the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 46; "Corona and Lime" reached No. 23. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard and sold 47,000 copies in its first week while receiving mixed reviews from critics. Despite being all but ignored in the hip hop community, Buzzin' gained its popularity in the pop world. It was featured in Pontiac commercials. The misadventures of Shwayze and Cisco Adler appeared to marketers as a successful advertising campaign. Shwayze and Adler were the focus of a reality television series on MTV,  Buzzin', which debuted on July 23, 2008.


=== Let It Beat (2009) ===
Their second studio album, Let It Beat was initially announced on February 4, 2009. The album's first single, "Get U Home", was released on June 28, 2009. After the lack of success from the reality TV series, Buzzin' that accompanied the first album, Shwayze was hopeful that he would gain greater music credibility. Rather than being famous for "Buzzin'", both Shwayze and Cisco Adler wanted to become more of a career band.
Adler was quoted saying he wanted to make the sound "bigger" on Let It Beat than it had been on Shwayze, their debut album. In an attempt to change the sound, the first single off the album, "Get U Home," has more of a rhythmic club feeling. "Crazy For You," a collaboration with the Ric Ocasek and Darryl Jenifer, sounds more like a rock track, while "Heart and Soul," with Roy Bittan, is a ballad. Snoop Dogg is also featured on "Livin' It Up" and the Knux is on "Dirty Little Girl".


=== Music mix tapes (2008â€“2010) ===
Shwayze and Cisco Adler released a mixtape, Rich Girls, on November 24, 2008.In June 2010, Adler released a mixtape, Super California Lipstick Sexy Magic Dope Shit.

In 2010, Shwayze was featured in a sketch on Nick Swardson's Pretend Time.


=== The W's free mini-album (2011) ===
In January 2011, Cisco Adler and Shwayze announced a new free "miniature album" The W's.  The title is a reference to the song "High Together" from Shwayze's first album in which he says "I live by the W's: Weed, and Women". More info on the mini album was released during "Cisco's House", a weekly webcast from Cisco Adler on Justin.TV.


=== Name clarification ===
The name Shwayze had, up until August 30, 2011, been the name of the duo Aaron Smith and Cisco Adler.
