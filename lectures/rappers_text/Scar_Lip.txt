Sierra Lewis was born in Bronx, New York City and raised in Brooklyn, New York City. She began writing poetry from a young age. At age 12, her mother died after getting into a hit and run car accident. At age 16, she got a scar on her lip after her brother punched her in the mouth while she tried to get into her house; the scar later became the basis for her stage name. According to her, she was abused by her aunt and uncle while living with them. She was eventually kicked out of her aunt's house and put into foster care, which led to her often moving between foster homes and detention centers in places such as Pennsylvania and Coney Island.

Her first three songs, "Therapy", "Suicide Awareness", and "Foster Care", were recorded from 2019 to 2020.Scar Lip first gained popularity with her 2022 single "Glizzy Gobbler", which went viral on TikTok as a meme.
