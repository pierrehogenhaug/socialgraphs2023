Initially known for producing tracks for Brooklyn-based alternative hip-hop group Das Racist, such as their popular debut single "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell", Diouf became known as a solo artist with the release of debut mixtape Dark York, released in April 2012. Its second single, the 5kinAndBone5-produced "Wut" garnered attention as the standout track from the project and manifested into a music video in June 2012.In November 2012, Le1f was featured on the song "Fuckin the DJ" by Mykki Blanco (which was co-produced with Diouf collaborator, Boody) from their Cosmic Angel: The Illuminati Prince/ss mixtape.

The mixtape featured guest appearances from artists such as Heems, DonChristian and Kitty.In August 2013, Le1f publicly criticised the rapper Macklemore for the latter's song "Thrift Shop", claiming that it borrowed its beat extensively from Le1f's own earlier song, "Wut", and proceeded to criticise Macklemore for another of his songs, "Same Love", claiming that it was not appropriate for a heterosexual to exploit an LGBT rights issue for financial gain.
