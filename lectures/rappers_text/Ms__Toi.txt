Toikeon Parham, known professionally as Ms. Toi, is an American rapper. She is featured on the Ice Cube song "You Can Do It" with Mack 10, released on the soundtrack albums for the feature films Next Friday and Save the Last Dance. "You Can Do It" became a major club hit in 2000, and its video received ample airplay on BET.


== Early life ==
Parham was born in Chicago, Illinois,. Her family moved to Inglewood, California, when she was 11 years old. Toi attended Inglewood High School, part of its Class of 1991. After being expelled from school, she moved to Sacramento, California, where she lived with an uncle and his family.


== Career ==
Upon graduating from high school, she began pursuing an interest in hip hop. She also performed with a group, Thick and the Girls, initially as a dancer. Her first studio recording, "Life Styles of the Rough and Sexy", was by her and Ronnie DeVoe, the nephew of her manager. She joined a rap group, Militia, and her performance on a remix of their track "Burn" led to further opportunities.
Toi's big break came when she was invited to record "You Can Do It" with Ice Cube and Mack 10. The song became a hit. Subsequently, Ms. Toi was signed to Universal Records. Her debut album, That Girl, was released a year later. It features multiple West Coast rappers, including E-40 and MC Ren, along with others like Nelly and producer Dame Grease.
