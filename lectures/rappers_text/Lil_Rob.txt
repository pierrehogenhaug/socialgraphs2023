== Career ==
In 1992, he began performing under the name Lil Rob & the Brown Crowd, and recorded a single titled "Oh, What a Night in the 619". Though it did not chart, it was later featured on his 1997 debut album Crazy Life, with the title shortened to "Oh, What a Night". In 1994 at the age of 18, his chin was shattered when he was shot in the jaw. He later denounced any gang affiliations. The numbers twelve and eighteen, which are tattooed on his forearms, represent the numeric value of the letters L and R, the initials of his stage name.In 2002, Lil Rob left Low Profile Records after a financial dispute, and signed to Upstairs Records. He found commercial success with the 2005 release Twelve Eighteen (Part I) in which the single "Summer Nights" received national airplay, a first in his career. "Summer Nights" peaked at #36 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #13 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The follow-up single, "Bring Out the Freak in You", peaked at #85 on the Hot 100 Charts, and at #20 on the Hot Rap Tracks. The exposure led to small roles in the 2005 Cuba Gooding, Jr. film Dirty and the 2007 Rob Schneider vehicle Big Stan, both of which were released straight to DVD in the U.S.
On June 29, 2007, Lil Rob made his very first appearance overseas in Okinawa, Japan. 1218 (Part II) was released in 2008 and featured the single "Let Me Come Back" featuring Fingazz.
