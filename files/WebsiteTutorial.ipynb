You can find some information on how to do this [here](https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/tutorials/github-pages-blog/): we'll detail the first alternative from that tutorial, but if you're comfortable with git, we suggest trying the second alternative as it is more flexible.\n",

    "*Matplotlib figures*: Matplotlib is easy, as it just exports plain images that you can include in your website. Choose a nice visualization form one of the previous weeks, save it to a file (**hint**: use `pyplot.savefig`), and add it to a page on your website (see [here](https://www.austinfriday.com/tutorial/adding-images-to-your-hugo-pages/) for a simple walkthrough).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** because we are taking the easy road and building our website in the docs folder, you'll probably have an issue when viewing the images once your site is online. See [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/can-i-reference-baseurl-from-content/2686/2) for a fix:\n",

    ">* You can then reference images in your markdown file as follows: `![image description]({{< baseurl >}}/image.png)`\n",
